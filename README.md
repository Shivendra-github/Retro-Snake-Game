# Retro-Styled Snake Game

This simple, retro-styled snake game guided by Ania Kubow. It's built entirely with vanilla JavaScript.

I've had a lot of fun adding my own styling and expanding the functionality, such as:

- Touch buttons
- Pop up windows
- Start and game over screens
- Sound effects
- D-pad-style buttons for use on mobile devices
